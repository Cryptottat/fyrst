## 2. pump.fun Token Description (~500 chars max)

FYRST is the first accountable token launchpad on Solana. Deployers stake SOL collateral into escrow. If they rug, buyers are automatically refunded pro-rata.

Cross-wallet reputation tracking scores every deployer (A-F grade) so serial ruggers cannot hide behind fresh wallets. Same bonding curve UX -- with a structural safety layer underneath.

95% of pump.fun tokens rug within 24h. FYRST changes the math.

Launch safe. Buy confident.

## 3. Launch Announcement Twitter Thread (10 Posts)

### Phase 1: Problem Awareness (Posts 1-3)

**Post 1:**
95% of tokens launched on pump.fun rug within 24 hours.

That is not a bear market stat. That is the baseline.

Every single day. Tens of thousands of tokens. Same outcome.

#Solana #DeFi

**Post 2:**
pump.fun has collected over $300M in protocol fees.

Most of that volume came from tokens that no longer exist. The platform profits. Deployers profit. Buyers absorb the loss.

This is the structure working as designed.

#Solana

**Post 3:**
The average active degen loses 0.5 to 5 SOL per day to rugs. That is $75 to $750 daily. $2,000 to $15,000 monthly.

No other market tolerates a 95% failure rate and calls it normal.

The problem is structural, not behavioral.

#crypto

### Phase 2: Solution Tease (Posts 4-6)

**Post 4:**
What if deployers had to stake real SOL before launching a token?

Not a fee. Not a promise. An escrow vault that pays buyers back if the deployer rugs.

What would that market look like?

#Solana #DeFi

**Post 5:**
What if every deployer wallet carried a reputation score -- and fresh wallets could not erase a history of rugs?

Cross-wallet tracking. Grade A through F. Permanent record.

Accountability changes behavior.

#crypto

**Post 6:**
Imagine a launchpad where the deployer has more to lose than the buyer.

That is not a hypothetical. That is a design choice no one has made -- until now.

#Solana

### Phase 3: Product Reveal (Posts 7-9)

**Post 7:**
Introducing FYRST -- the first accountable token launchpad on Solana.

Deployer collateral escrow. Cross-wallet reputation scoring. Automatic refund on rug.

Same bonding curve. Different rules.

fyrst.xyz

#FYRST #Solana

**Post 8:**
How FYRST works:

1. Deployer stakes SOL into escrow (minimum 1 SOL)
2. Reputation score assigned (A through F)
3. Bonding curve launches
4. Rug within 24h -- escrow refunds buyers automatically

No trust required. The system enforces it.

#FYRST

**Post 9:**
FYRST Deployer Reputation Score:

-- Tracks history across linked wallets
-- Scores 0 to 100 (grades A through F)
-- Rug history permanently recorded
-- Higher reputation = lower collateral requirement

Serial ruggers cannot hide. The data follows them.

#FYRST #Solana

### Phase 4: CTA (Post 10)

**Post 10:**
The pump.fun era normalized a 95% rug rate.

FYRST is the structural correction. Collateral. Reputation. Refunds.

Launch safe. Buy confident.

## 4. Standalone Tweet Templates (Ongoing Engagement)

### Tweet Template 1: Protocol Metrics Update
```
FYRST Protocol -- Weekly Numbers

Total collateral in escrow: [X] SOL
Tokens launched: [X]
Deployers scored: [X]
Refunds processed: [X]
Rug detection rate: [X]%

The system operates. The data is on-chain.

fyrst.xyz | $FYRST
```

### Tweet Template 2: Deployer Reputation Highlight
```
[X] deployers currently hold an A-grade reputation on FYRST.

They staked real SOL. They maintained their tokens. They earned their score.

On FYRST, reputation is not a badge -- it is a verifiable record.

Check any deployer: fyrst.xyz/deployer/[address]

#FYRST #Solana
```

### Tweet Template 3: Refund Success Case
```
A deployer removed liquidity [X] hours after launch.

Within seconds, FYRST escrow distributed [X] SOL back to [X] buyers pro-rata. No manual claims. No governance vote. No waiting.

This is what structural accountability looks like.

$FYRST
```

### Tweet Template 4: Comparative Architecture
```
What buyers see on most launchpads:
-- Anonymous deployer
-- Zero collateral
-- No recourse after rug

What buyers see on FYRST:
-- Deployer reputation grade (A-F)
-- SOL staked in escrow vault
-- 24h auto-refund protection

Same token launch. Different architecture.

```

### Tweet Template 5: Builder / Deployer CTA
```
If your project is legitimate, FYRST costs you nothing.

Stake collateral. Earn a reputation score. Launch to buyers who trust the system, not just the promise.

Deployers with track records attract more capital. That is how a healthy market works.

## 5. Community Announcement (Telegram / Discord)

### Launch Announcement

```
FYRST -- The First Accountable Token Launchpad on Solana

FYRST is now live.

We built FYRST because 95% of tokens launched on Solana rug within 24 hours. That is not an opinion. That is the data. And no existing platform has a structural incentive to fix it.

FYRST changes the architecture of token launches:

DEPLOYER COLLATERAL ESCROW
Every deployer must stake SOL (minimum 1 SOL) into a PDA escrow vault before launching a token. This collateral is locked and cannot be withdrawn by the deployer. If a rug event is detected within the 24-hour safety period, the escrowed SOL is automatically distributed to buyers pro-rata.

CROSS-WALLET REPUTATION SCORING
Every deployer receives a Deployer Reputation Score (0-100, grades A through F). The score factors in launch history, rug incidents, token lifespan, and cross-wallet analysis via Helius DAS API. Creating a new wallet does not reset your history. The data follows you.

AUTOMATIC REFUND MECHANISM
If a deployer removes liquidity, dumps tokens, or triggers a rug event within 24 hours of launch, the escrow smart contract initiates automatic pro-rata refunds to all affected buyers. No manual claims required.

BONDING CURVE COMPATIBILITY
FYRST uses a pump.fun-compatible bonding curve. The trading experience is familiar. The difference is the safety infrastructure underneath.
